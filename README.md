System Architecture

This system uses the following technologies and frameworks:

Python
Django web framework
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for sentiment analysis
Scikit-learn machine learning library for sentiment classification
SQLite database for storing tourist reviews and destinations data
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface

The system architecture consists of the following components:

Data Collection: The system collects tourist reviews from various online sources, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, and stores them in an SQLite database.
Sentiment Analysis: The system uses a machine learning algorithm implemented with the Scikit-learn library to classify the sentiments expressed in the reviews. The trained model assigns a sentiment score to each review.
Recommendation Engine: The system generates personalized recommendations for new tourist destinations based on the user's preferred sentiment and the sentiment scores of existing reviews.
User Interface: The system provides a user-friendly web interface for users to select their preferred sentiment and view personalized recommendations.

Dataset

The system uses a dataset of tourist reviews and destinations data for sentiment analysis and recommendation generation. The dataset consists of reviews and ratings for various tourist destinations, such as hotels, restaurants, and attractions, from various online sources. The dataset is stored in an SQLite database and can be updated or modified as needed.
